On January 13, JetBrains announced a new IDE for the C# language code named Project Rider. As an exclusive Visual Studio user, I wondered what on earth I would need a new IDE for. It took me all of 5 minutes for it to click.

What it comes down to are choices. There have been a few attempts over the years to create an IDE either directly for C# or that can handle C# but nothing has ever really panned out. While this project is just in it's infancy, we can expect that this will be a great tool for us in the coming year. It won't be able to match the powerhouse that is Visual Studio. However, many developers don't need to have a powerhouse. They need to be able to be swift and nimble. Have you tried loading up multiple copies of Visual Studio without a sizable chunk of RAM? It usually isn't a pretty sight.

When the makers of Resharper, one of the most coveted C# tools available, create their own IDE, I would hope that all C# engineers would notice. Even if you decide that the tool set isn't ready for you to use. It could be a tool in the future that you may prefer over Visual Studio. I plan to keep an keen eye on this project for many years to come.
