long-description: "I'm an impostor. I'm a fraud of an engineer. I am just waiting for an individual to call me out and say, "I'm sorry, but you don't belong here." I will hang my head in agreement, quickly gather my personal effects, and head for the exit."

For far too long, I have sat alone wondering when I would be called out. There would be a variety of reasons to have the spotlight show all my glaring imperfections:

* Lack of skills
* Shallow depth of knowledge
* Seemingly endless mistakes I make. 

At times, I've felt small and alone. Fighting a battle which I must be the only one going through. When I frequently glance around an engineering floor, I would often see those around me who were so fluent in their respective domain. I would be in awe of how they could look at a problem and see a solution so easily when I was stuck in an endless cycle. I would feel as though I was alone in my feelings of inferiority.

Whether this played out in my mind on a conscious or unconscious level, this came to the forefront of my mind a year or so ago. I was driving home from work listening to a podcast. One host was describing Impostor Syndrome to the other. While I had never heard of this, many unfocused issues in my professional life became clear. I now had a name for battle I have been fighting for years.

> Impostor syndrome is a concept describing individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

In an industry where technology can rule nearly every aspect of our daily life, as individuals and a collective, we have the chance to grow and further ourselves beyond any expectations. For my part, this means acknowledging I struggle and deal with shame. It means identifying the parts of myself which prevents me from being who I can be and being fully authentic in my life.

Let's cover the two primarty parts of having imposter syndrome.

## Inability to Internalize My Accomplishments

While everyone's mileage may vary, this is particularly pronounced for me. Many would say they often remember the mistakes they make. In my own career, I find it very difficult to recall anything noteworthy unless it is a negative mistake or failure. 

A recruiter might ask those I work or previously worked with for a list of accomplishments. If you were to ask me for a list of accomplishments in the last decade of employment, I would freeze and race to try and bring up anything. There is a good chance I would not recall my most impressive feats but rather lackluster events.

A recruiter might ask me what are some of the greatest strengths I have. If I haven't had time to reflect on this before the question, my answer would consist of ramblings and inconsequencial thoughts. It would certainly be easier if they ask me what my weaknesses are. I spend far too much time worrying about my weaknesses.

## Persistent Fear of Being Exposed

For the first eight years of working as an engineer, I felt like I was one mistake away from being let go. My first job was so rough that it left me feeling entirely worthless an an engineer. Even after leaving a truly horrendous environment, I was in a perpetual state of fear. Any day, a manager would question who brought me on board. Any day, a senior engineer would ensure that my time was coming to a close. Were it not for mentors who took me aside, spoke clearly about my potential, and helped me grow in my subsequent jobs, I would not be the engineer I am today.

# Shame

Shame is one of the critical components of these two situations. I have a tremendous amount of shame in my life. From the way it shaped me as a kid to my repeated mistakes as a young engineer, shame has been a major repeating event in my life. Shame has had too long to fester as a hidden element of my life. I've worked over the last few years to shed the shame I've carried. It will continue to take years to work towards a shameless life. 

We must never let the shame prevent us from doing the work we are capable of accomplishing. Shame cannot live when we are open about what we feel and how it is hindering us. I would extend a challenge to all: do not let shame be a hidden burden you carry. We all deal with shame and we all can remove the shame we feel when we share it with the world. 

Unburden yourself. Lift all around you. [Live a life so shameless](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ehrTIFn0kb4BYtkbrK7Je?autoplay=true&v=T).
