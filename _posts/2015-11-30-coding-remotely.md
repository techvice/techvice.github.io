I've never worked as a remote employee. I don't know what it means to have to work from thousands of miles from your peers. But I have been thinking more about this aspect in my daily work. My wife and I are planning on a move to Arizona in 2016. As part of that, I'm keeping all possibilities open. These are the potentials as I see them:

  * Stay on with a Utah based company, working remote from my home.
  * Find a company that is very open to remote employees and work from home.
  * Find a company in the Phoenix area and work at headquarters full-time.
  * Find a company in the Phoenix area and spend 3-4 days working at headquarters and 1-2 days working from home.

As a self-service, I've recorded this post so I can update and keep track of my thoughts. If anyone does read this post, I wouldn't mind any feedback on your own experiences or the experiences of others as you have seen/heard about them.<br />

## The Good

### Minimized Distractions
> Or better distractions?

Even though I have a young child at home, the number of distractions I get at the office is more than what I would get at home. Especially in an open environment, I have to put on headphones just to drown out the noise of others on an hourly basis.

Even having a daughter *give* me small breaks means that I have more chances to interact with her during the day. Sometimes a few hours in the morning and evenings just aren't enough.

### Enjoying Life 
> Life still occurs from 9-5

Having the ability to stop working for just 30 minutes after my child gets home from school would be an important aspect to me. It doesn’t detract from my overall productivity to take time for my child and allows me to have an important impact on them. It’s hard to put a price on being involved in the life you live at any point during the day. 

### No Commute
> Does rolling out of bed count?

Although I enjoy a good Sunday drive, rush hour is frustrating. It’s not a burden that makes me want to live within walking distance to work. In the past, when I have had to commute an hour to and from work, I didn't come home in a better mood that I do today with a 10 minute commute.

### Work for an Amazing Company
> Startup, Corporate. All opportunities are available.

We can't all live in Palo Alto and I know my wife would rather not pay Silicon Valley rent prices. My family is looking to settle down but that may not be in the same location as a company I'd like to work for. As long as a company is open to remote employees, it's a win-win. I get to work for a company I'm passionate about and they get the talent they are searching for.

### Saving Money
> Your desktop is already going to be on. Might as well use it.

Surprise! Not driving 30-60 minutes each way is going to save you. Gas money. Vehicle maintenance. Plus the company is going to be saving money on space where you would be working.

## The Not So Good

### Personal Relationships
> "Want to go grab a beer? …Anyone?"

It can be more challenging to shoot the breeze while waiting for a compiler or pulling down the latest. Video and group chats can help relieve that. However, if you are the only remote engineer and your team has a celebratory lunch, you get to celebrate from the comfort of your office chair. Bringing the team together for regular or annual retreats will help build these relationships.

### Adversity to Change
> Going against the grain can be a challenge

This point is written specifically with my wife in mind. Whenever I have brought up the topic of working remote, she gets a look on her face of uncertainty. She trusts me to make the right decisions and will support me. However, working remote seems to cause her immediate concern for my job security. Perhaps you have a similar spouse or partner who has similar concerns. If you decide to work remote, you might find you have a battle in convincing those who are impacted.<br />

### Learning to Work Remote
> It's not a skill that can be done on day one.

From the time we were young to today, we have been raised in a communal setting. This may not mean it was the best situation for each of us individually but it is a familiar setting for us. I've worked occasionally from home but I don't consider it the same aspect. In those times, I had a need to stay at home but I also felt like I could still be a productive team member. If I was offered a full-time remote position today, I would be excited at the prospect but I would also recognize a risk involved with accepting that position.

## Reading Material
Alex Turnbull's blog is one that I have come across in my research of working remotely. It's become a new favorite of mine on the subject because he is writing about his experiences. When he started GrooveHQ, he decided to find remote employees because his local market was lacking. So he has been documenting the companies progress and many of those posts include challenges or thoughts about working remotely. One of the quotes I've like best so far is:

> Teams succeed because of culture, principles and vision, and the habits you build around all three of those factors.

Alex makes some great points in his blog post and I recommend you read check it out.

## My Thoughts
A new habit I've been working on in the last two months is tracking my time. Tracking productivity on my desktop computer has been great. Before I was tracking, I would find myself at the end of the day trying to think of the work that I have accomplished. Now, I know what I have done and I know how long I spent in front of the computer working on that. 

Overall, I think that working remotely will continue to increase in popularity among small businesses and teams. I think that the market is shifting slightly and it will be interesting to see the growth in working from home careers.
