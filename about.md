Hello! My name is Daniel Calkins. 

I'm a maker-of-software living in Phoenix, Arizona. 

During the past ten years, I've worked as an engineer with a variety of companies. These range in industry from computer forensics with [AccessData](https://accessdata.com/) to education with [Imagine Learning](https://www.imaginelearning.com/).

I currently work at [American Express Global Business Travel](https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/) leading the internal desktop applications suite.

A transplant to the Phoenix area, I code in the shade and occasionally soak up the sun rays. I enjoy spending time with my family and enjoying the beautiful desert landscape. I married my best friend Brittany and together we have two beautiful energetic daughters.

If you'd like to get in touch, [drop me a line]({{ "/contact" | relative_url }}).
