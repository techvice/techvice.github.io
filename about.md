Hello! My name is Daniel Calkins. I'm a .NET fanatic living in Chandler, Arizona.

You can read all about my work history on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcalkins" target="_blank" rel=”nofollow”>my LinkedIn profile</a>.

As a transplant to the Phoenix area, I code in the shade and occasionally soak up the sun rays. I enjoy spending time with my family and enjoying the beautiful desert landscape. I married my best friend Brittany and together we have two beautiful energetic daughters.
