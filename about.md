Hello! My name is Daniel Calkins. I'm a .NET fanatic living in Chandler, Arizona.

As a transplant to the Phoenix area, I code in the shade and occasionally soak up the sun rays. I enjoy spending time with my family and enjoying the beautiful desert landscape. I married my best friend Brittany and together we have two beautiful energetic daughters.

If you'd like to get in touch, [drop me a line]({{ "/contact" | relative_url }}).
